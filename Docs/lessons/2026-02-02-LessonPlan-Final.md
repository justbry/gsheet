# "Teach These Things Freely unto Your Children"
**Walking with God: The Story of Enoch • Genesis 5 & Moses 6 • ~30 minutes**

## Part 1: The Mystery in Genesis

Genesis 5 lists ten generations from Adam to Noah. Each follows the same pattern—except one.

**Read Genesis 5:5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20** — Notice the repeated phrase: "and he died."

**Read Genesis 5:21-24** — What is different about Enoch?

→ What phrase replaces "and he died" for Enoch?
→ "Walked with God" appears twice (v. 22, 24). What do you think this means?

### What Genesis Doesn't Tell Us → What Moses 6 Reveals

| Genesis doesn't tell us | Moses 6 reveals |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| What was the world like? | Satan had "great dominion" (6:15) |
| How was Enoch called? | Spirit descended; God commanded (6:26-27) |
| Did he feel qualified? | "But a lad," "slow of speech" (6:31) |
| What did he teach? | The Fall, repentance, salvation (6:48-62) |
| What does "walk with God" mean? | "Abide in me... walk with me" (6:34) |

## Part 2: Enoch's Calling

*Invite class members to read each passage aloud, then discuss. (Consider writing references on the board.)*

## Part 3: Walking with God Today

📖 **Genesis 5:24** — *"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him."*

→ After reading Moses 6, what new meaning do you find in this verse?
→ What would it look like for you to "walk with God" this week?
→ Enoch felt inadequate but obeyed anyway. What can we learn from his example?

**💡 Key Insight:** Genesis tells us *that* Enoch walked with God. Moses tells us *how* and *why*. Both invite us to do the same.
