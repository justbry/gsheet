# Lesson Plan — Feb 2, 2026 (1st Sunday)
**Teacher:** Jay | **Time:** 2:30 PM | **Duration:** ~40 min

## Combined Lessons
- CFM Week 5: Genesis 5; Moses 6 — "Teach These Things Freely unto Your Children"
- CFM Week 6: Moses 7 — "The Lord Called His People Zion"

## Theme: Enoch — From Reluctant Prophet to Builder of Zion

## Flow

### 1. Opening (5 min)
- Opening prayer
- Quick intro: "Today we cover two weeks — Enoch's call and the city of Zion. One thread connects both: what happens when ordinary people walk with God?"

### 2. Enoch's Call & Overcoming Weakness (10 min)
**Read:** Moses 6:31 — Enoch says "Why is it that I have found favor... I am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech"
- **Discussion:** When have you felt inadequate for something the Lord asked of you? What happened?
- **Key point:** God calls the weak and makes them strong (cf. Moses, Jeremiah, Joseph Smith)
- **Read:** Moses 6:34–36 — The Lord anoints Enoch's eyes and he sees things not visible naturally

### 3. Gospel from the Beginning (8 min)
**Read:** Moses 6:51–52, 57–58 — Faith, repentance, baptism, Holy Ghost taught from Adam's day
- **Discussion:** Why does it matter that these principles existed from the very beginning?
- **Key point:** The lesson title — parents are to "teach these things freely" to their children (Moses 6:58)

### 4. Building Zion (12 min)
**Read:** Moses 7:18 — "The Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them"
- **Discussion:** What are the 4 characteristics of Zion in this verse? Which is hardest for us today?
- **Read:** Moses 7:28–37 — God weeps for his children
- **Discussion:** What surprised Enoch about God's reaction? What does this teach about God's nature?
- **Key point:** Zion is a condition of the heart, not just a place (D&C 97:21)

### 5. Application & Close (5 min)
- **Challenge:** Pick one of the 4 Zion characteristics. What's one thing you can do this week to build that in your home or community?
- Closing testimony, prayer
